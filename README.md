# Advent of code 2021

Here are my solutions for [advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). They won't be the most polished solutions, but they should work.

I'll be using Python 3.10.

## Notes
### Day 2
First time using the new `match` statement in 3.10 🎉.

### Day 4
I liked how clean this solution looked.

### Day 5
`namedtuple`s really made the code much easier to work with.

### Day 8
The first solution that I'm not very happy with (but hey, it works 🤷‍♂️). The number of solutions is narrowed down from `7!` to `8` for each line, then they're tested individually.
